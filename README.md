# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

- Semantic tags are important for other developers to read your code
- This module challenge was to remove all the semantic elements and change it to an easier read and follow code structure
- I learned that non semantic elements can be difficult to read as a developer to know where each element of a website is
- All the acceptance criteria met
- Here is a link to the deployed site:
